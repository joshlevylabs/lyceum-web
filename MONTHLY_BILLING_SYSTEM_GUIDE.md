## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema

**Core Tables:**
- `billing_periods` - 30-day billing cycles for each user
- `invoices` - Generated invoices with payment status
- `invoice_line_items` - Detailed breakdown of charges
- `billing_usage_snapshots` - Usage data captured at billing time
- `billing_automation_log` - Audit trail for billing processes

### Pricing Configuration

Located in `src/lib/flexible-pricing.ts`:

```typescript
export const PRICING_CONFIG = {
  basePlatformFee: 10,        // $10/month base
  licenses: {
    basic: 5,                 // $5/month per license
    professional: 15,         // $15/month per license  
    enterprise: 25,           // $25/month per license
  },
  clusters: {
    small: {
      development: 20,        // $20/month
      production: 40,         // $40/month
      analytics: 30,          // $30/month
    },
    // ... medium, large sizes
  },
  additionalUsers: 3,         // $3/month per extra user
  storageOverage: 0.10,       // $0.10/GB/month over limit
};
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the billing schema creation:

```sql
-- Execute the SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: database-setup-monthly-billing.sql
```

Or use the API endpoint:

```bash
POST /api/billing/setup
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Cron Job Authentication
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string

# Supabase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

### 3. Stripe Webhook Setup

Configure Stripe webhooks to point to:
```

## üîÑ Billing Process Flow

### 1. Monthly Billing Cycle

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Activity] --> B[Usage Tracking]
    B --> C[30-Day Period Ends]
    C --> D[Create Usage Snapshot]
    D --> E[Generate Invoice]
    E --> F[Create Stripe Invoice]
    F --> G[Send Invoice]
    G --> H[Process Payment]
    H --> I[Update Status]
```

### 2. Automated Process

Every month (via cron):
1. Find billing periods past their end date
2. Create usage snapshots for each period
3. Generate invoices with line items
4. Create corresponding Stripe invoices
5. Process payments automatically
6. Update billing statuses
7. Create new billing periods

### 3. Payment Processing

1. Invoice created in system
2. Stripe invoice created with line items
3. Customer payment method charged
4. Webhook confirms payment
5. System invoice status updated
6. Next billing period begins

   - Audit trail maintenance

### Monitoring Alerts

Set up alerts for:

2. **Admin Permissions**: Sensitive operations restricted to admins
3. **Stripe Integration**: Use Stripe's secure payment processing
4. **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
5. **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all billing operations
6. **Webhook Verification**: Stripe webhook signatures verified

## üìß Notifications (TODO)

Future email notifications:
- Invoice generated
- Payment successful
- Payment failed
- Usage alerts
- Billing changes
