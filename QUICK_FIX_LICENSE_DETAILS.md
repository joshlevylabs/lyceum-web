# Quick Fix: License Details Page Error

## Problem
The license details page is failing with "Failed to fetch license details" error.

## Root Cause
The API is trying to access a new `responsible_user_id` column that doesn't exist in your database yet.

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Apply Database Fix (Recommended)
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Copy and run the SQL file
psql -f fix-license-details-error.sql

# OR manually copy the contents of fix-license-details-error.sql
# and paste into Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Option 2: Temporary API Fix (If you can't run SQL immediately)
The API has been updated to be backward compatible, so it should work even without the database changes.

## Verification

1. **Check the database change worked:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   SELECT column_name 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'license_keys' AND column_name = 'responsible_user_id';
   ```

2. **Test the license details page:**
   - Go to Admin > Licenses
   - Click on any license to view details
   - Should load without error

## What This Fixes

- ✅ License details page loads correctly
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Sets up responsible user functionality
- ✅ No data loss or disruption

## Next Steps

Once the quick fix is applied, you can:
1. Use the full responsible user billing features
2. Assign licenses to multiple users
3. Set different payment responsible users
4. Transfer billing responsibility

## Files Changed
- `src/app/api/admin/licenses/[licenseId]/route.ts` - Made backward compatible
- `fix-license-details-error.sql` - Database migration script

The system will work with or without the responsible user column, but adding it enables the full billing features.
