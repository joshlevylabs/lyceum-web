# 🔧 User Management Issues - Fixed

## ✅ **All Issues Resolved**

### **Issue 1: USER-X Keys Shifting** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: User keys (USER-1, USER-2) were regenerated based on array position, causing keys to shift when new users were added.

**Solution**: 
- Added `generateStableUserKeys()` function that sorts users by `created_at` timestamp
- Keys are now permanently assigned based on creation order, not display order
- USER-1 will always be the first user created, regardless of filtering or new additions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Added stable key generation

---

### **Issue 2: LIC-X Keys Shifting** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: License keys (LIC-1, LIC-2) had the same issue as user keys.

**Solution**:
- Added `generateStableLicenseKeys()` function with the same stable sorting approach
- License keys now maintain consistency across sessions and new license creation
- LIC-1 will always be the first license created

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/admin/licenses/page.tsx` - Added stable key generation

### **Issue 3: Auth Callback 404 Error** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Invited users received emails with links to `/auth/callback` which returned 404.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive auth callback page at `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
- Handles invite acceptance flow with JWT token processing
- Includes user info display and welcome experience
- Automatically redirects to dashboard or password setting
- Includes error handling for failed authentications

**Features Added**:
- ✅ Invite token processing
- ✅ Session creation from invite tokens
- ✅ User welcome screen with account details
- ✅ Automatic profile backfill
- ✅ Error handling and retry options
- ✅ Progress indicators and status messages

### **Issue 4: Password Management Missing** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: No way for invited users to set or modify their passwords.

**Solution**:
- Created dedicated password setting page at `src/app/auth/set-password/page.tsx`
- Added dashboard page at `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` for post-login experience

**Password Setting Features**:
- ✅ Real-time password strength validation
- ✅ Password confirmation matching
- ✅ Show/hide password toggles
- ✅ Security requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)

**Dashboard Features**:
