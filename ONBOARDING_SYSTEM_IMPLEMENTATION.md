# üéì Lyceum Trial License Onboarding System

## Overview

A comprehensive onboarding system has been implemented for Lyceum's CENTCOM application that ties trial licenses to mandatory onboarding sessions. This system ensures trial users complete required training before maintaining active license status.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Requirements Implementation

**‚úÖ Trial License Onboarding Requirements:**
- **Base Sessions**: 3 √ó 30-minute sessions for CENTCOM core functionality
- **Plugin Sessions**: +1 √ó 30-minute session per additional plugin license
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Trial licenses become inactive if onboarding requirements aren't met

**‚úÖ Admin Portal Integration:**
- Full management interface at `http://localhost:3594/admin/onboarding`
- Session scheduling, tracking, and reminder management
- User progress monitoring with completion rates and deadlines
- Analytics dashboard with key metrics

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Tables Created

**`onboarding_requirements`** - Defines requirements per license/plugin type
**`onboarding_sessions`** - Individual training sessions with scheduling and completion tracking  
**`onboarding_progress`** - Overall user progress with compliance status
**`onboarding_reminders`** - Automated reminder system for sessions and deadlines

### Key Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Automated triggers for new trial license initialization
- Compliance checking functions with automatic license suspension
- Comprehensive audit logging

## üîß API Endpoints

### Session Management
- `GET/POST/PUT /api/admin/onboarding/sessions` - Complete session CRUD operations
- `GET/POST/PUT /api/admin/onboarding/progress` - User progress tracking
- `GET/POST/PUT /api/admin/onboarding/requirements` - Requirement configuration

### Automation & Business Logic
- `POST /api/admin/onboarding/calculate-requirements` - Auto-calculate sessions needed
- `POST /api/admin/onboarding/auto-initialize` - Initialize new trial user onboarding
- `POST /api/admin/onboarding/validate-license-status` - Compliance validation for license checks
- `GET/POST/PATCH /api/admin/onboarding/reminders` - Reminder scheduling and delivery

### Bulk Operations
- `POST /api/admin/onboarding/trigger-initialization` - Bulk initialize existing trial users
- `PUT /api/admin/onboarding/auto-initialize` - Batch onboarding setup

## üöÄ License Validation Integration

**Enhanced License Validation Process:**

1. **Standard Validation**: Existing license format, expiration, and permission checks
2. **‚≠ê NEW: Onboarding Validation**: For trial licenses, validates:
   - Onboarding progress exists and is on track
   - Required sessions are completed within deadline
   - Automatic license suspension for overdue onboarding
   - Graduated warnings as deadlines approach

**Integration Points:**
- `src/app/api/licenses/validate/route.ts` - Main license validation with onboarding checks
- `src/app/api/v1/licenses/validate/route.ts` - CENTCOM format validation
- `src/app/api/licenses/validate-enhanced/route.ts` - Advanced validation features

## üéØ Admin Portal Features

### Session Management Tab
- **View All Sessions**: Upcoming, past, and in-progress sessions
- **Session Scheduling**: Calendar interface with admin assignment
- **Status Updates**: Mark sessions as completed, no-show, or rescheduled
- **Session Notes**: Admin notes and user feedback tracking
- **Filtering & Search**: By status, plugin, user, or session type

### Progress Tracking Tab  
- **User Progress**: Visual progress bars showing completion rates
- **Deadline Monitoring**: Days remaining until license suspension
- **Status Indicators**: Pending, in-progress, completed, overdue states
- **License Status**: Active/suspended license tracking
- **Completion Analytics**: Session completion rates and patterns

### Analytics Dashboard
- **System Metrics**: Total sessions, completion rates, overdue users
- **Performance Indicators**: Average completion time, success rates
- **Risk Management**: Users at risk of license suspension
- **Trend Analysis**: Onboarding completion trends over time

## üìß Reminder System

### Automated Reminders
- **Session Scheduled**: 24 hours before scheduled sessions
- **Session Due**: For users who haven't scheduled required sessions
- **License at Risk**: 7 days before onboarding deadline
- **License Suspended**: Immediate notification for suspended licenses

### Reminder Delivery
- **Email Integration**: Ready for email service integration (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- **Scheduling**: Intelligent scheduling based on user progress
- **Batch Processing**: Bulk reminder sending capabilities
- **Status Tracking**: Delivery confirmation and failure handling

## üîÑ Business Logic & Automation

### Auto-Initialization
**New Trial License Detection:**
- Database triggers detect new trial license assignments
- Automatically calculates onboarding requirements based on enabled plugins
- Creates required session placeholders
- Sets up initial reminder schedule
- Generates compliance deadline (30 days default)

### Compliance Enforcement
**Automated License Management:**
- Daily compliance checks for overdue onboarding
- Automatic license suspension for missed deadlines
- Grace period warnings before enforcement
- Reactivation workflows for completed onboarding

### Session Calculation Logic
```
Base Requirements: 3 sessions (CENTCOM core)
+ Plugin Requirements: 1 session per enabled plugin
= Total Required Sessions

Example:
- CENTCOM trial with Analytics + Reporting plugins
- Total: 3 (base) + 1 (analytics) + 1 (reporting) = 5 sessions
```
